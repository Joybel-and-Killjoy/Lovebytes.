Humanity & Morality

If saving the person you love meant condemning hundreds of strangers to death, would you still save them?

Is it ever truly possible to be selfless, or are all good deeds rooted in ego?

Would you rather live in comfort with lies, or suffer in pain with truth?

If someone you love commits a terrible crime, do you turn them in or protect them?

If peace required suppressing the individuality of everyone around you, would you still want it?

Should people be judged more by their actions or their intentions?

Is killing ever morally justifiable if it prevents future violence?

Would you sacrifice your own future to secure someone else’s freedom?


Identity & Consciousness

If a version of you lived in another world and made all the opposite choices… which of you is the real you?

If your memory was wiped but your body remained, are you still “you”?

Do you believe people can truly change, or are we just repeating patterns in prettier costumes?

What’s one belief you hold that you hope isn’t true — but fear it is?

If no one knew who you were, would you still be the same person?

Would you erase your darkest memories if it meant erasing the lessons they taught you?


Personal Philosophy

Is justice about fairness, or is it about control?

If your soulmate was someone who had done something terrible… could you still love them?

Would you burn down a corrupt system if it meant becoming the villain to everyone watching?

What’s one thing you hope no one ever finds out about you — and why?

Are you more afraid of being known... or being forgotten?

If your survival required someone else's suffering, would you accept that burden?

If you had to choose between fighting for your freedom or protecting the safety of the people who fear you... which would you choose, and why?
